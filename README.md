## Example

### Match Analysis

The carry of this match was undoubtedly NickNickNick on Aatrox. With 14 kills, 12 deaths, and 9 assists, NickNickNick dealt a whopping 52,628 damage to champions, earned 16,087 gold, and reached level 18. Despite his deaths, his significant damage output and gold earned make him the standout player in this game. It's safe to say that NickNickNick carried his team to victory with his performance. On the other hand, the most useless player in this match was AmazonFireTV on Bard. With only 1 kill, 6 deaths, and a staggering 31 assists, AmazonFireTV's damage dealt to champions was a mere 15,646, and he earned 11,263 gold. His vision score of 96 may have been impressive, but his lackluster performance in terms of kills and damage dealt makes him the least useful human being in this game. Maybe Bard's skills were better suited for playing instruments rather than battling on the Rift. In conclusion, while NickNickNick shone as the carry with his Aatrox performance, AmazonFireTV's Bard failed to make a significant impact in the match. Remember, in League of Legends, sometimes it's better to stick to playing music rather than trying to be a hero on the battlefield.
